# Fine-Grained-Demand-Forecasting
Fine Grained Demand Forecasting


The objective of this notebook is to illustrate how we might generate a large number of fine-grained forecasts at the store-item level in an efficient manner leveraging the distributed computational power of Databricks. This is a Spark 3.x update to a previously published notebook which had been developed for Spark 2.x. UPDATE marks in this notebook indicate changes in the code intended to reflect new functionality in either Spark 3.x or the Databricks platform.
